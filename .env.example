# WARNING: Commenting after a variable's value DOES NOT WORK in .env files.
# In other words, don't to this: `FOO=value # this is a comment`.
# This would give the value "value # this is a comment" to the FOO variable.
# You need to use single-line comments instead, e.g:
# ```
#   # this is a comment:
#   FOO=value
# ```
